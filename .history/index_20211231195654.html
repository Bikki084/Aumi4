    content="Debra M. Storyby Olga Vasilevsky on June 08, 2021Tell us a little about yourself or your family or your hobbies.a. I have a masters in mathematics with a specialty in statistics; I worked in the computer industry; I've worked in education as an Academic Dean; I worked at Cape Kennedy during the Apollo Program for three months and the Skylab Program for three months. My name is on the monuments dedicated to the Spaceworker's Hall of Fame. I worked with Broadway legend, Ann Reinking, for 15 years. We created world renowned Broadway Theatre Project, which is a training school for those who wish to perhaps have a career on Broadway. They are taught by the best in the business from Broadway and Hollywood. In addition to this, I was Ann's Assistant Choreographer on Chicago and Fosse on Broadway. I worked on all national and international tours. With Fosse, I eventually became the Director/Choreographer of the International Tour. I was the Associate Choreographer on Look of Love at Roundabout Theatre and a number of other projects.b. My father was a mechanical engineer for IBM at Cape Kennedy. He was known as a very valuable member of the launch team. He found an error in one of the capsules and as a result of bringing it to the attention of all he won the highest award a space worker can be awarded. His name is on all of the monuments at the Spaceworkers Walk of Fame. My mother was simply the strongest and most admirable woman to have as one's mother.Who is your fashion inspirationI do not have any one person who inspires me fashion-wise. I have my own style dictated by what turns me on when I am shopping. I tend toward the unconventional. The style that I find most appealing is that of Issey Miyake.Who is your fashion inspirationI do not have any one person who inspires me fashion-wise.

The style that I find most appealing is that of Issey Miyake.If none, what is your position on how you express yourself through fashion?I have enough pieces of odd bits of tops and bottoms that I am able to put together outfits that show that I am not conservative but most likely dabble in an artistic field.Do you feel there is a link between our way to express ourselves via fashion and women empowermentI feel that the ability for a woman to choose to dress the way she wishes to for a particular event indicates empowerment. When there is a business party and all of the women show up in conservative pants and tops, it shows me that a 'costume' has been assigned and that has been dictated by their job place or that of their mates. It shows lack of empowerment. I would wear what I wanted to wear.What do you personally think about women empowerment as a movement and what it means for you?I have always had to deal with fighting for power for women. Given that I worked toward a Masters in Mathematics in the early 70's, my classes were very small and the number of women never exceeded 3.

                            Academic Dean; I worked at Cape Kennedy during the Apollo Program for three months and the
                            Skylab Program for three months. My name is on the monuments dedicated to the Spaceworker's
                            Hall of Fame. I worked with Broadway legend, Ann Reinking, for 15 years. We created world
                            renowned Broadway Theatre Project, which is a training school for those who wish to perhaps
                            have a career on Broadway. They are taught by the best in the business from Broadway and
                            Hollywood. In addition to this, I was Ann's Assistant Choreographer on Chicago and Fosse on
                            Broadway. I worked on all national and international tours. With Fosse, I eventually became
                            the Director/Choreographer of the International Tour. I was the Associate Choreographer on
                            Look of Love at Roundabout Theatre and a number of other projects.</p>

                            in one of the capsules and as a result of bringing it to the attention of all he won the
                            highest award a space worker can be awarded. His name is on all of the monuments at the
                            Spaceworkers Walk of Fame. My mother was simply the strongest and most admirable woman to

                            has been assigned and that has been dictated by their job place or that of their mates. It

                            power for women. Given that I worked toward a Masters in Mathematics in the early 70's, my
                            classes were very small and the number of women never exceeded 3. When I worked at the Cape,
                            my manager once slapped me on the backside. When I worked in education, my superior once
                            said, "I wish I could take you on a slow boat to China." There was really no one to go to
                            about these things at that time but there was certainly a way to handle it. You simply
                            cooled your heels when it came to being in the presence of that person. You cooled your
                            attitude, also, not to the point of rudeness, however. I tell students I teach that when it
                            comes to the casting couch - LOSE THE JOB! by walking out! You have the power.</p>
